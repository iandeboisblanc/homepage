      <p>
        I'm a full stack software engineer who loves to build mind-blowing apps for web,
        mobile, and virtual reality. I write code that is fun to play with, both for developers
        and users, because it's clean, intuitive, and friendly.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        I've worked extensively on both the front and back ends of several apps, created
        RESTful APIs, designed complex database schemas, and engineered responsive user interfaces.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        The technologies I know and love include A-Frame VR, HTML5, CSS3, React, React Native,
        Node, Angular, jQuery, Postgres, Sequelize, SQL, Backbone, DigitalOcean, git, MongoDB,
        Mongoose, and ES6.
      </p>
